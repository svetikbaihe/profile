## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS/SASS
- Flexbox
- OOP
- Vite

### What I learned

This was my first project deployed on Vercel if I am not mistaken. There were some obstacles while doing this, however I've managed to deal with them eventually.

Maybe the following info would be useful for someone (and that's what I'll do next time). If you deploy your project with Vercel, you need to place your static assets, in my case images, into a public folder and remove 'public' in the img path. Live and learn.

### Continued development

It was pretty difficult for me to deal with the links' section, I got a little help with writing the objects in array, frankly speaking. So yeah, OOP is definitely still confusing and I'm still learning how to work with it.
